    <p>When I was eleven, I announced that I
        wanted to be a psychologist. Although my
        life took a very different path for a
        number of years, I found myself drawn
        back to that early fascination with how
        the mind works and the desire to help
        others. So I changed career paths and
        became a counselor. I have never
        regretted it and I cannot imagine doing
        anything else. It is incredibly rewarding.
        My clients continue to teach me so much
        and astound me with their bravery and insights</p>
    <p>I am recovered from growing up in a
        dysfunctional family. I am an adult child
        of an alcoholic and a child of divorced
        parents. I have recovered from an eating
        disorder, and from the trauma of a car
        accident and the death of a husband. So I
        know firsthand that a person is able to
        stretch and do what seems impossible-to
        heal and to learn and grow from the
        tragedies and issues in our lives. I have
        had my own counseling (never go to a 
        counselor who has not!) and so I know that
        counseling can really help, if we are open to
        trying new things.</p>
